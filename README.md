# Portfolio-Project-Uplift-Aero
 Portfolio Project for Uplift Aerospace Interview Process

## What is this for?
This is a public project requested for the next step in Uplift Aerospace's hiring process. As part of this stage, I was asked to submit a code sample, and a single PR, that constitutes about 2-to-3 hours of work in order to give Uplift Aero some insight into how I think and work.

## Project Description - From Scratch "AI Photobooth"

Earlier, I found a reddit user who [made a tool that does most of the heavy lifting for unity and ai generated backgrounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1fi8mvu/finally_made_a_tool_that_does_most_of_the_heavy/) 

Inspired by their work, I'd like to take the time to build a similar tool and perhaps deploy it for VR Photobooth applications!

Users would be able to snap photos of themselves in a Generative AI-Landscape, potentially drop assets or invite guests to build memories together!

## How AI is implemented

We're taking a rendered frame from Unityâ€™s Main Camera, sending it to a Hugging Face model (like a text-guided or reference-based image generator), and overlaying the result in real-time (or near real-time) in the game's viewport.

Think of this as generating an AI-stylized, interpretation, of the current scene using the environment as context.
